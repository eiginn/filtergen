	FULL-DISCLOSURE (or HONESTY)

WHAT'S THIS?

Here, I explain the status of the package in non-salesman mode.
It might help you to decide whether this package is currently
useful to you (though shouldn't put you off contributing).


STATUS

The language is likely to evolve as more features are implemented.
Specifically, I'd like it to express fundamental networking and
filtering concepts, rather than being an iptables macro language.

The transparent proxying, masquerading and logging support is not
as flexible as I'd like it to be.

"Grouping" (sub-chain) support is a fairly recent addition and,
even in backends which support it (iptables, ipchains), isn't
quite right yet.

I have been using it on my home gateway for around a year now, and
have a dozen or so production servers, and a production router
using it too (all via the iptables backend).  It has all worked
very well.  But "working well" does not imply security, and I have
not expended a great deal of effort in auditing.

See the filter_backends(7) man page for more details on backend-
specific issues.
