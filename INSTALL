INSTALLING filtergen
==============

Installing filtergen is easy.

If you're on a Red Hat-like RPM-based system, you should be
able just to run "rpm -ta" on the tarball.

Otherwise, just ensure that you have gcc and flex installed,
type "make", then "make install".

AT-BOOT
-------

There are two files in the extras/ directory which make life
easier in Red Hat-like systems.  My usual installation makes
an /etc/filter/ directory and puts the ruleset and a Makefile
in there.  The latter knows how to turn the filter script
into an appropriate output file ("make" does this), and how
to load the ruleset ("make install").

filter.init is a SysV init script which invokes make at boot
to do these things.  Run "/etc/init.d/filter help" to see what
it can do.  It supports chkconfig.

Note that if you intend to load filters at boot, you should
install filtergen in /sbin/, in case not all filesystems are
mounted at that point.

The RPM does all of these things.  It does _not_ configure the
init script to run at boot, though.  You can do that with
"chkconfig filter on".
